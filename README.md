# derbydump


Derby SQL dump. This project will take a Derby database and export the data in it to a file. It is similar, but not feature parity, to the mysqldump executable.

## Fork

- Updated gradle to version 5.0
- Updated apache derby to 10.14 (still works with java 8)

## Features

* Export any Derby data to an SQL file
* Resulting file is suitable to import to mysql and possibly other databases
* Export from local Derby files or running Derby server
* Optionally transform the table names (for example to correct case sensitive names in mysql)
* Handles binary data and clob
* Handles UTF data

## How to use

1. Install maven, git and java
